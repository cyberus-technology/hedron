// Below is the code for userspace MSR access. It is mostly used for platform
// thermal and power management, but also for platform discovery and other
// purposes. Due to the vast amount of MSRs it's impractical to devise safe and
// generic kernel abstractions and instead we rely on trusted userspace
// components (PDs with passthrough permissions) to do the right thing and give
// them direct access to MSRs.
//
// That being said, we do not blindly allow access to all MSRs, but make
// exceptions for MSRs where we know that:
//
// - the hypervisor wholly owns them and needs them for correct functionality,
//
// - they leak private information about the hypervisor, such as its address
//   space layout,
//
// - have a correct way to get their information from userspace already.
//
// The lists below are not complete and will never be. They are expected to
// change over time (as is our rationale which MSRs to exclude).
//
// Most importantly this filtering is not a security boundary and no untrusted
// component should have access to this API.
